# Math-Modeling-Final-Project-Course-Model

> This is the repo to hold my final project for MATH2111: Mathematical Modeling

## Running the project

Since we are on a containerized code space, not much has to be installed for this project to run.

### Installing Dependencies

> Each command below must be pased in the terminal.


I have aliased the following command to generate a dependency list and install it:

```shell
make install-deps
```
### Running the project

The project can be ran via 

```
make run
```

You can edit the code in `abm.py` to run it with alternate settings.
